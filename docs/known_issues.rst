Known Issues
============

Dialog style
------------

Dialogs, e.g. file dialogs, could appear not styled since it inherits from OS
theme/style as described in the issue
`#172 <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet/issues/172>`__.
There are some options that can be exploited there.


System icons
------------

Similar to the Dialogs, default icons are inherited from OS but we
are planning to create our own set of icons to provide a more uniform UI. See
`#192 <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet/issues/192>`__.
